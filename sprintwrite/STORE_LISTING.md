## Justification for Permissions

### Storage Permission
**Justification:**
```
SprintWrite uses Chrome storage to save your sprint history, user preferences (themes, sound settings, timer presets), and daily writing goal progress. All data is stored locally and can be synced across your Chrome browsers if Chrome Sync is enabled. No data is transmitted to external servers.
```

### Host Permission (docs.google.com)
**Justification:**
```
SprintWrite needs access to Google Docs pages to inject the sprint timer widget and detect the Google Docs word count widget. The extension only accesses the word count display element and does not read, modify, or transmit your document content.
```
