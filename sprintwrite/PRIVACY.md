# Privacy Policy for SprintWrite

**Last Updated:** November 22, 2024

## Overview

SprintWrite is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle data when you use the SprintWrite Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

SprintWrite is a completely **privacy-first** extension. We do NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

### What Data is Stored Locally

SprintWrite stores the following data **locally on your device** using Chrome's storage API:

1. **Sprint History**
   - Start and end times of your writing sprints
   - Word count at start and end of each sprint
   - Duration of completed sprints
   - Document titles where sprints were completed
   - Words per minute calculations

2. **User Preferences**
   - Theme selection (Light, Dark, Nord, Solar, Midnight)
   - Sound effect settings (on/off)
   - Celebration animation settings (on/off)
   - Display mode (Toolbar vs Float)
   - Widget position (if in Float mode)
   - Timer preset values
   - Daily writing goal
   - Minimize on start setting

3. **Daily Progress**
   - Words written today
   - Number of sprints completed today
   - Date of last activity

### Chrome Sync Storage (Optional)

If you have Chrome Sync enabled in your browser, the above data may sync across your Chrome browsers where you're signed in with the same Google account. This is handled entirely by Chrome's built-in sync feature and is controlled by your Chrome settings.

**Important:** We do not have access to your synced data. All syncing is done directly by Chrome.

## What We Do NOT Collect

- ❌ Document content or text you write
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Any analytics or tracking data

## Third-Party Services

SprintWrite does NOT use any third-party services, analytics tools, or external servers. All functionality is contained within the extension itself.

## Data Transmission

SprintWrite does NOT transmit any data to external servers. All data remains on your device or in your Chrome Sync storage (if enabled).

## Permissions Explained

SprintWrite requests the following permissions:

### 1. Storage Permission
